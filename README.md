# Credit-Card-Data-Analysis
This is a simple yet interactive project where we take credit card and customer inforamtion. I follow a complete routine, starting from the  database  creation  till the creation of a complete interactive dashboard.

**1. We Create a database named ccdb.**
**2.Table Creation:**
-Create a table cc_detail to store credit card details.
-Create a table cust_detail to store customer details.

**Setting Date Format:**
-Set the date format to Day-Month-Year (DMY) using SET DATEFORMAT DMY.

**Data Import:**
-Use BULK INSERT to import data from credit_card.csv into the cc_detail table.
-Use BULK INSERT to import data from customer.csv into the cust_detail table.

**Importing data to PowerBi:**
- We  connect the micorsoft sql developer to powerbi and then laod the data into powerBI
- We then create mulptile stacked bard charts, line and stacked column charts, tables and cards to display data according to diffrent metrics against diffrent metrics to explore and   
  visualize the data and draw insights.

  **Invitation:**
  - I would like to invite users to come into the dashboard and draw insights using the various reports and filters and also suggest to leave some recommendations if there are any.
